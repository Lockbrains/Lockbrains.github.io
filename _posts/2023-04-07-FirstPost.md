# CG#1 Linear Transformation

Here's the table of contents. Just keep in mind all of the contents will be written in English. I will (probably) update a Simplified Chinese translated version if I had time in the future. XD

The following will write about the linear transformations. In definition, linear transformation $a'$ of a point $a$ is defined as $a' = \mathbf{M}a$, where $\mathbf{M}$ is a matrix. The following matrix are frequently seen linear transformations.
### Rotation
### Shear
### Scale
**Translation** is not a linear transformation in its own dimension. But we can make it into a linear transformation by introducing *homogeneous coordinates(齐次坐标)*.
