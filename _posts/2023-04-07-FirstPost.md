The following will write about the linear transformations. In definition, linear transformation $a'$ of a point $a$ is defined as $a' = \mathbf{M}a$, where $\mathbf{M}$ is a matrix. The following matrix are frequently seen linear transformations.
### Rotation 旋转
### Shear 错切
### Scale 缩放
**Translation（平移）** is not a linear transformation in its own dimension. But we can make it into a linear transformation by introducing *homogeneous coordinates(齐次坐标)*.
