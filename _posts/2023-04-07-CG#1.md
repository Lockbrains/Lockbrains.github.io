## 2D Transformations
The following will write about the linear transformations. In definition, linear transformation $a'$ of a point $a$ is defined as $a' = \mathbf{M}a$, where $\mathbf{M}$ is a matrix. The following matrix are frequently seen linear transformations.
### Rotation
### Shear
### Scale
We want to satisfy that $x' = sx\cdot x , y'=sy\cdot y$, where $sx, sy$ are the factors on the $x$ and $y$ directions. \
Thus it makes sense that the scale matrix is 
$\begin{matrix}
s_x & 0 \\
0 & s_y
\end{matrix}$

### Translation
Translation is not a linear transformation in its own dimension. But we can make it into a linear transformation by introducing *homogeneous coordinates*.
