## 2D Transformations
The following will write about the linear transformations. In definition, linear transformation $a'$ of a point $a$ is defined as $a' = \mathbf{M}a$, where $\mathbf{M}$ is a matrix. The following matrix are frequently seen linear transformations.
### Rotation
Assume the angle is $\theta$ for the query point $(x,y)$.

We know that:
- $x' = x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta$.
- $y' = x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta$.

Thus, it makes sense that the rotation matrix of $\theta$ is
```math
\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta & -\sin\theta\\\sin\theta & \cos\theta\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}
```
  
### Shear
### Scale
We know that
- $x' = sx\cdot x$
- $y'=sy\cdot y$

where $sx, sy$ are the factors on the $x$ and $y$ directions. 

Thus it makes sense that the scale matrix is 

```math
\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}s_x & 0\\0 & s_y\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}
```


### Translation
Translation is not a linear transformation in its own dimension. But we can make it into a linear transformation by introducing *homogeneous coordinates*.
