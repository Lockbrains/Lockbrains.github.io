# CG#0 Math Review

This part covers the review of some basic maths that will be used in Computer Graphics, namely some basic Linear Algebra and some calculus. We will simply skip the trivial definitions like vectors or matrices, and focus on the theorems or frequently used methods in CG.

## Linear Algebra
### Vectors
1. Def (Linear Map) A map $f$ between vector spaces is linear if $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$, and $f(ax) = af(x)$.
2. Def (Affine) A function $f$ is called an _affine_ function if we have a set of weights $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$ s.t. $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i = 1$, and $f(w_1x_1 + ... + w_nx_n) = \sum_i w_if(x_i)$ for any collections of $n$ vectors $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$.
3. Projection of $\textbf{a}$ onto $\textbf{b}$: $<\textbf{a}, \textbf{b}> \cdot \textbf{b}$.\
   Note: This tells that inner product (or dot product) shows how two vectors line up.
4. Def (Cross Product) The cross product of 2 vectors $u$ and $v$ has the following property:
   - $|u \times v| = |u||v|\sin\theta$.
   - The direction of $u \times v$ is normal to both of $u$ and $v$.
   - Following right hand rule. Point your index finger along $u$ and mid finger along $v$, thumbs up, this is the direction of $u\times v$.

### Matrices
1. Def (Determinant) For 2D vectors $\textbf{u} = (u_1, u_2)$ and $\textbf{v} = (v_1, v_2)$, define $\det(\textbf{u}, \textbf{v}) = u_1v_2 - u_2v_1$. \
Note: For more dimensions, it is ultimately the sum of major diagonal minus the sum of minor diagonals.
2. Properties of determinant
- $\det(A^T) = \det(A)$
- $\det(\lambda A) = \lambda^n\det(A)$, if $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$.
- $\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)$.
3. Def (Inverse Matrix) For $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, if $\exists B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, such that $AB = BA = I$, then we say $A$ is invertible and $B$ is $A$'s inverse matrix. We denote $B = A^{-1}$.

## Calculus
1. Def (Directional Derivatives) Assume $z = f(x,y)$ is defined in the neighbourhood $U(P_o)$ of $P_o(x_o, y_o)$. If $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $P_0(x_0, y_0)$, then the function has a directional derivative at any direction $\textbf{l}$, and we have $D_{\textbf{l}}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial l} = f_x(x_0, y_0)\cos\alpha + f_y(x_0, y_0)\cos\beta$, where $\cos\alpha, \cos\beta$ is the cosine of the direction $\textbf{l}$.
2. Def (Gradient)
