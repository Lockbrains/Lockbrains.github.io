# CG#6 Ray Tracing, Radiometry-Based

In Whitted-Style Raytracing, we made many wrong assumptions which will make the final result looks not that photo-realistic. The radiometry knowledge helps us to precisely control some of the factors in the rendering process.

### Definitions

1. <u><b>Def</b></u> (Radiant Energy) Radiant Energy ($Q[J]$) is the energy of electromagnetic radiation. We can think of it as the total # of hits of rays onto the object.
2.  <u><b>Def</b></u> (Radiant Flux) Flux ($\Phi[W = \frac{J}{s}][lm]$) is the energy of electromagnetic radiation passed _per second_.\
Through the definition above we know that $\Phi = \frac{dQ}{dt}$, and since the flux is the energy per second, it is also called **power**.

Bringing the radiometry into 3D space, we need to have a way to calculate space, and that is what **solid angle** is for.
3. <u><b>Def</b></u> (Solid Angle) The solid angle of a region on a sphere is defined as $\Omega = \frac{A}{r^2}$, where $A$ is the area of the region. \
<u>Note</u>: Accroding to the definition, a complete sphere has solid angle $4\pi$. \
<u>Note</u>: We use _steradian_ as a form unit of solid angle, but in fact the unit should be 1. 


4. <u><b>Def</b></u> (Irradiance) Irradiance is the 2D density of radiant flux. Thus it is defined as $E(\rho) = \frac{d\Phi(\rho)}{dA}[\frac{W}{m^2}][\frac{lm}{m^2} = lux]$.\
<u>Note</u>: Irradiance is a property for a surface. Here $\rho$ is a point(query point), so it is an extremely small surface where $A$ is almost 0. 
<u>Note</u>: When calculating the area of the region, we are calculating the projected area which is perpendicular to the light beam. The equivalent area should actually be $A\cos\theta$, and this is what the **Lambert's Law** is saying.
5.  <u><b>Def</b></u> (Intensity) Intensity is the solid angular density of flux. Thus it is defined as $I(\omega) = \frac{d\Phi}{d\omega}[\frac{W}{sr}]$.
6.  <u><b>Def</b></u> (Lambert's Law) $E = \frac{\Phi\cos\theta}{A}$, where $A$ is the original area of the region, and $\theta$ is the angle between the surface and the perpendicular direction of the light.
7.  <u><b>Def</b></u> (Radiance) Radiance, or **Luminance** describes the change of ray over direction, and is defined as the flux per solid angle per unit area. We can also use the following definition.
8.  <u><b>Def</b></u> (Radiance) Radiance is the solid angle density of irradiance. $L(\rho, \omega) = \lim_\limits{\Delta \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta E_\omega(\rho)}{\Delta \omega} = \frac{dE}{d\omega} [\frac{W}{m^2 \dot sr} = nit]$, where $\omega$ is the direction of the ray, and $\rho$ is the query point.

Till now we should have a complete mind of the relationships between the physics definitions.
